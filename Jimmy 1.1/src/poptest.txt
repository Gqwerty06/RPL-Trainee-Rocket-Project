    VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!
    DO NOT PLUG IN THE firingPin pin BEFORE pressing EN after giving the ESP32 power!!!
    Steps should be: 
    1. Plug in ESP32
    2. Start Serial Monitor on Computer
    3. Press EN button to reset program
    4. Plug in GPIO pin for firingPin

    Firing Procedure- I coded in 2FA for launch for safety, read below if you need assurance
    of how I programed this thing
    1. Input 6 to pass first check. Any nonzero integer input will end the program. Please don't try 
    characters or strings, I trust you to not be stupid.
    2. Input 1 to confirm firing. Again please don't try strings.
    3. That's it. If the onboard blue LED lights then it should have fired. 

    I do not take any responsibility for lost fingers or destroyed property

    FAQ: 
    Q. I see wingdings when pressing EN... Should I be concerned?
    A. Well the code works doesn't it? be concerned and ask me if you can't read 
    "Input 0 to fire" at the end of the wingdings. Check your baud rate too.

    Q. What safety funcitons did you put in this thing?
    A. Well you have 2FA for fire, and requiring specific inputs I guess. From what I know
    strings default to 0 on parsein, so neither inputs being 0 is safe maybe? Pretty much nothing
    else though. I'm not a CS major

    Q. Can I do this in Jimmy's bedroom?
    A. Yes! The intent of this program is to cause as much property damage to Jimmy as possible
    while maintaining relative safety to whoever wants to run this program.
